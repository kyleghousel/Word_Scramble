# Word Scramble App
From Hacking With Swift by Paul Hudson "The game will show players a random eight-letter word, and ask them to make words out of it. For example, if the starter word is “alarming” they might spell “alarm”, “ring”, “main”, and so on."
Builds on skills/experience with handling @State,List, onAppear(), Bundle, fatalError(), and NavigationStack.
